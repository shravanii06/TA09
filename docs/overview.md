# ResilienceNet Overview

ResilienceNet is a climate-health intelligence platform that predicts
disease outbreak risks using environmental data.

The system calculates a climate risk score, predicts possible diseases,
and automatically triggers emergency funding if risk crosses a threshold.

The dashboard displays risk level, predicted disease,
funding status, and recommended medical supplies.
