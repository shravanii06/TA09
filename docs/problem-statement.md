#Problem Statement

Climate-related disasters such as heatwaves, flood, and pollution spikes are increasing in frequency and intensity. These environmental shocks directly trigger health crises including asthma, water-borne diseases, vector-borne outbreaks, and heat stress.

However, current medical funding systems are reactive. Financial assistance reaches loacal only after outbreaks escalate and healthcare facilities are already overwhelmed. This delay - known as the "data-to-dollar lag " - occurs because environmental monitering systems are not integrated with healthcare financing mechanism.

Result:
- Clinics lack advance medical supplies.
- Staff are unprepared for sudden patient surges.
- Valnerable communities suffer preventable health losses.
- Funding decisions rely on manual reporting instead of predictive intelligence.

There is an urgent need for a predictive, automated, and localized climate-helath response system that can detect environmental risk early and trigger timely medical preparedness before crises escalate.
